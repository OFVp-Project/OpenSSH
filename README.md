# What is OFVp Project

OFVp Project was born out of a need to be a free alternative to VPN solutions that are self-managing and easy to maintain and update.

## Whats is SSH Server

This is one of the servers to make an SSH connection for port tunneling, with user and password authentication.

> Your host system doesn't need to install any software to use this server, just Docker or a container manager.

## Dependencies

Thanks [@mscdex](https://github.com/mscdex) for the package [ssh2](https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2) without it it would still depend on OpenSSH as the server and several other dependencies.
